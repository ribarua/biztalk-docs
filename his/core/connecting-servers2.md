# Connecting Servers
After you have determined a suitable deployment model and subdomain configuration, you must choose how to connect [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] computers to the host system, to client workstations, and to other [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] computers.  
  
 This section explores how to choose:  
  
- Connections between Host Integration Server computers and the host  
  
- Network protocols for Host Integration Server computers and clients  
  
  To understand the connectivity options, you should first examine the different physical connections and network protocols that [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] supports.
